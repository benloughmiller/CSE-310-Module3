# Overview

This is a number guessing game written in Java. It selects a number from 1-100 at random and prompts the user to guess what that number is. It tells the player if they are too low or too high, and will tell them if their guess is very low or very high. It then writes and pulls game history from a csv file. 

The purpose for this software is to provide an example of how Java can be used in programming games. It uses one class and several functions to run the game, and shows how Java can: take input from the user, use that input within the program, and read/write information to files.

# Development Environment

I used the Java Development Kit and VSCode to write this program in Java. 

I used several libraries, including:
- BufferedReader
- FileReader
- FileWriter
- IOException
- InputMismatchException
- Random
- Scanner

# Future Work

- Make a function that displays statistics of the user's score history 
- Separate the functions into different classes based on their purpose
- Make an algorithm that allows the computer to try and solve the game itself as an example.
